  "description": "Apply deep learning-based lung segmentation to CT images. This method uses the lungmask library to automatically segment lung regions from chest CT scans. It accepts medical imaging files in various formats (NIfTI, DICOM, NRRD, MHA, MHD, and other SimpleITK-supported formats) and returns a binary lung mask indicating lung tissue regions. The method supports multiple pre-trained models optimized for different use cases (standard lung segmentation, lobe segmentation, COVID-19 analysis). Input images must be 3D CT volumes. The output mask is saved as a NIfTI file (.nii.gz) with the same dimensions and spacing as the input image, along with detailed statistics including lung volume measurements.",
